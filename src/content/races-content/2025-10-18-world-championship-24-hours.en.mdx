# World Championship 24 hours

The World Championship 24 hours is held in Albi, France this year.

The race website can be found here: [Albi 24 hours](https://www.albi24h.fr/)
and it is also where you should be able to follow the race live.

The race starts on October 18th at 10:00 and ends on October 19th at 10:00.

The costs to participate are self-funded and therefore you can support and sponsor me, my supporter and my team here on [Sponser.me/emilingerslev2025](https://sponsor.me/emilingerslev2025).
